To enable AWS Cost Explorer, follow these step-by-step instructions. If you're not seeing the “Enable Cost Explorer” option, you may be looking in the wrong section or lack the right permissions.

🔹 Step-by-Step: How to Enable AWS Cost Explorer
Login to AWS Console
Go to 👉 https://console.aws.amazon.com

Go to Billing Dashboard
In the top right, click your account name or click “Services” → search for and select Billing.

On the Billing Dashboard:

Look at the left-hand sidebar

Click Cost Explorer under Cost & Usage Reports

Click “Enable Cost Explorer”

If you're using it for the first time, you will see a blue “Enable Cost Explorer” button.

Click it once.

It takes around 24 hours for historical cost data to be generated.

🔸 If You Don’t See the Enable Button:
✅ Already enabled — If you or someone else enabled it before, it won’t appear again.

🔒 Permissions issue — Make sure your IAM role has access to:

aws-portal:ViewBilling

ce:* for Cost Explorer APIs

Since Cost Explorer is already enabled, here’s what you can do next step-by-step to analyze your AWS costs effectively:

🔹 Step 3: Create a Cost Report (Hands-On)
✅ Goal: Understand where your AWS spending is going.
🔸 Step-by-Step: View Monthly Cost Breakdown by Service
Go to Cost Explorer
➜ AWS Cost Explorer Console

Click “Create report” or “View all reports”

Choose “Monthly costs by service”

Set filters (optional but useful):

Date Range: Last 6 months

Granularity: Monthly

Group By: Service

Filter by Linked Account, Region, or Tag if needed

Click “Apply”

You’ll now see a bar graph and a data table showing costs for each AWS service per month.

🔹 Step 4: Identify Cost Drivers
Look at the services with the highest cost:
EC2?
S3?
Lambda?
RDS?

👉 These are your top cost drivers.

🔹 Step 5: (Optional) Enable Daily or Tag-Based Breakdown
To dive deeper:
Change Granularity to Daily
Use “Group by” → Tag (e.g., Environment:Dev, Project:Netflix)
This is useful for cost optimization in DevOps.

🔹 Step 6: Set Budgets or Alerts (Optional)
If you want to control costs:
Go to Budgets → Create Budget
Set a limit (e.g., ₹2000/month)
Add email alerts if usage exceeds 80% or 100%
Would you like me to:

🧪 Give you a real-world scenario (like a Dev/Test account cost analysis)?

 you're now at the “Create Budget” screen in AWS Billing. Let's proceed to create a simple cost alert using the Zero Spend Budget or a Monthly Budget, depending on your goal.

🔹 Step 7: Set Up a Budget (with Email Alerts)
✅ Option 1: Zero Spend Budget (Good for free-tier tracking or test accounts)
Use if: You want to get notified even if ₹1 is spent.

Budget Name:
➤ My Zero-Spend Budget

Email Recipients:
➤ Add your email (e.g., nandeeshgm239@gmail.com)

Click Create Budget

🎉 Done! You’ll get an alert if any AWS charges happen.

✅ Option 2: Monthly Cost Budget (Recommended for general usage)
Use if: You want to stay within a monthly limit (e.g., ₹2000 or $25/month)

Select: Monthly cost budget
Click “Next”
Set Budget Name:
➤ DevOps Monthly Budget
Period: Monthly
Budget amount: ₹2000 or $25 (your choice)
Include all services (default)

➕ Notifications:
Add email alert at 80% and 100%
Example emails:
nandeeshgm239@gmail.com
Click Next → Review → Create Budget

🔔 Result:
You will now get notified when:

Spend crosses ₹1600 (80%)
Spend crosses ₹2000 (100%)

🧪 Want to Test It?
Trigger a small spend using S3, EC2, or a Lambda function — AWS will notify you if thresholds are crossed.


Here's how you can trigger a small spend on AWS safely and within free tier limits (or minimal cost) so that your budget alert gets tested.

🔹 Step 8: Trigger a Small Spend (Manual & Safe)
Here are 3 safe options:

✅ Option 1: Launch a t2.micro EC2 instance
(Safe for free tier or triggers tiny cost if free tier exhausted)

Steps:
Go to EC2 Dashboard → Launch Instance

Choose Amazon Linux 2 AMI

Instance Type: t2.micro or t3.micro (free tier)

Leave storage default

Click “Launch” with default settings

Wait 15–30 mins and terminate instance

💰 Approximate cost: ₹0 if in free tier; ₹1–2 otherwise

✅ Option 2: Upload a file to Amazon S3
Steps:
Go to S3 → Create a new bucket (or use an existing one)

Upload a test file (e.g., 1–10 MB)

Wait ~1 day — AWS will charge for storage and PUT request

💰 Approximate cost: ₹0.01–₹0.10

✅ Option 3: Trigger a Lambda Function
Steps:
Go to Lambda → Create Function
Author from scratch: Name = TestBudgetFunction
Runtime = Python 3.9 (default)
Code:
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    print("This is a test function.")
    return "OK"
Deploy → Click Test (default config)

💰 Approximate cost: ₹0 if under free tier; ₹0.01 if over
🔔 Step 9: Wait for Budget Alert
Once you incur a charge:
AWS will evaluate budget thresholds every ~8–12 hours
Email alerts will be sent once spend > ₹0.01 or crosses your threshold




                               Reserved Instances (RIs)

🔷 What is a Reserved Instance (RI)?
A Reserved Instance is not a physical instance — it's a billing discount you commit to in exchange for reserving capacity for 1 or 3 years on EC2.

🔹 In Simple Words:
On-Demand EC2 = Pay-as-you-go (hourly)

Reserved Instance = Commit upfront, get up to 72% discount

🔁 It’s like booking a hotel for a year in advance instead of paying night-by-night.

🔸 Key Features:
Feature	Reserved Instance
Discount	Up to 72% off vs on-demand
Commitment	1 year or 3 years
Payment Options	No Upfront, Partial, or All Upfront
Scope	Specific Region / Availability Zone
Instance Family	Locked to instance type (e.g., t3.medium)
Best For	Steady-state workloads (e.g., web servers, databases)

🔹 Types of Reserved Instances
1.Standard RIs
Highest discount (~72%)
Fixed instance type, region, platform
Cannot change once purchased (limited flexibility)

2.Convertible RIs:
Lower discount (~54%)
Can change instance type, OS, region
More flexible for changing workloads

🔸 Payment Plans
Plan	Description
All Upfront	Pay full amount at start → Highest savings
Partial Upfront	Pay some now, rest monthly
No Upfront	Pay monthly (lowest discount)

🔹 When to Use RIs?
Use Case	Use RI?
Web App runs 24/7	✅ Yes
Dev/Test server, irregular usage	❌ No (Use Spot or On-Demand)
Database instance	✅ Yes
CI/CD Build Agents (scalable)	❌ No (consider Auto Scaling + Spot)

🔐 Bonus: Capacity Reservation
If you choose “Zonal Reserved Instance”, AWS reserves capacity for your instance in that AZ — useful when you need guaranteed instance availability (e.g., high availability apps).

🧪 Example Scenario
Suppose your company runs a t3.medium EC2 for production 24/7:

| On-Demand Monthly Cost | ₹1,200 |
| Reserved (1-Year, All Upfront) | ₹350–₹400 |
→ Savings: ~₹800/month or ₹9,600/year

🧰 DevOps Tip
Use the AWS Cost Explorer RI Recommendations tool:
Go to: Billing → Cost Explorer → Recommendations
It will suggest what instances to reserve based on past usage
